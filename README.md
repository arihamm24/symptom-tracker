# symptom-tracker
UI/UX accessibility project for Hack Like W@CC 2025. Though we could not successfully integrate our backend code with our front-end design, our Figma design and prototype were viable representations of our desired goal.

######

Chronic Care is a symptom tracker application that addresses UI design flaws that make alternative apps inaccessible to users with chronic pain. 

Our design features large, well-spaced buttons and input fields, a high contrast color palette, and a dyslexic-friendly font enhance accessibility for other secondary stakeholders as well as our target market

Because it directly addresses the needs of an often forgotten segment of the disabled population while also offering benefits for any user, ChronicCare is a demonstration of accessible and inclusive UI/UX design, as well as a labor of love.
